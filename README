This game was written in less than 48 hours for Ludum Dare 30.

There is hardly any sound, the graphics are bad and the code is a mess, but hopefully you can still enjoy it for a few minutes.

Compilation
===========

If you want to build the program yourself you must install the following dependencies.
You should use the links below to be sure that the versions are right.
Especially don't use the official TGUI version, since I have used a custom version that had not been released yet.

All three projects use cmake, and on e.g. linux this is just a matter of calling cmake and make without needing any configuration.
